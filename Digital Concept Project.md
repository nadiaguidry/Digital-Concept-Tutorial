**WHAT IS A SVG IMAGE?**

A SVG image is "an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999"

**HOW TO GET STARTED**
1. Start by clicking the following [link](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp) to begin.

2. Scroll down to **SVG Example** and click **Try It Yourself**.

3. After clicking **Try It Yourself**, you are ready to begin. You can change the stroke/fill colors, height/width, and location of the circle shapes. You can achieve this by replacing the original colors and numbers with your choices.
4. This basic tutorial allows you to enter normal colors such as pink, purple, orange, red, yellow, blue, green, black, white, etc. If you are interested in custom colors, you can click the [link](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=hex+color+picker&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) to pick a color of your choice.

  *Example: **"#f442d4"**
7. After picking the colors of your choice, you can now change the height/width to any numbers of your choice. This allows you to create large, medium, or small circles.

8. Finally, after picking your colors and sizes, you have created a cool SVG image!
9. While circles are interesting, some may be interested in creating a variety of shapes. This [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Basic_Shapes) provides information of how to make even more unique shapes!
